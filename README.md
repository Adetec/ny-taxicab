# Taxicab NYC Map - React
The last project requiered for the completion of Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree. Building in from scratch, I learned how design patterns and UI libraries like React assist in developing a manageable codebase. I explored how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for me to use.
